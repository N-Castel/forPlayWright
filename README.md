  Hi, welcome to this in-progress repo of test using Playwright.
  
  it's available for download and running smoothly!
  
  Basically there is a basepage class in which I can create methods that can be reused in the project. 
  
  Then there is a page class(of the web to test) where I add the locators and the methods to interact with the DOM elements that later will be used in the Test case.
